    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400 g Macaroni Pasta</li>
        <li>100 g Butter</li>
        <li>2 Minced Garlic Cloves</li>
        <li>50 g Flour</li>
        <li>1 L Milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sweet smoked paprika</li>
        <li>200 g Grated Cheddar</li>
        <li>100 g Grated Mozzarella</li>
        <li>200 g various cheeses (for topping)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place your macaroni pasta into boiling water with a big pinch of salt and cook 2-4 minutes less than the packet instructions (this is because the pasta will keep cooking in the oven so you don't want to overcook the pasta). Drain and set aside with a knob of butter to stop it from sticking together.</li>
        <li>
            Place an ovenproof pan on medium heat and add in the butter. Once melted, add in your minced garlic followed by the flour. Whisk until it all comes together, then gently pour in your milk, a few tablespoons at a time, mixing as you go so that the butter and flour takes in the milk and starts to form a creamy sauce. Gradually pour more of the milk in and keep stirring. You don't want any lumps!</li>
            <li>
            Once you've poured all of your milk in, add in your paprika. Leave to simmer for 5 minutes until the sauce has thickened slightly.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 190C/375F. Add in your grated cheddar and mozzarella followed by ground black pepper. Give everything a good whisk until combined, smooth, and cheesy. Taste the sauce and season with salt, pepper, paprika, or more cheese based on your liking!</li>
            
           <li> Once your pasta is cooked, add to your pan and mix until well combined. Evenly spread out the macaroni pasta.</li>
            <li>Top with grated cheddar cheese and mozzarella. Place into the oven and bake for 20 minutes. Then place under the grill for 2-5 minutes until brown and bubbling.</li>
    </ol>
