    <p>One of the keys to CHEWY chocolate chip cookies is to use more brown sugar than granulated sugar. The molasses in the brown sugar draws in more moisture, making the cookies thicker, softer, and chewier. For extra chewy cookies, try adding an extra egg yolk to this recipe. You can also replace half or all of the all-purpose flour in this recipe with bread flour for an ultra-chewy bite.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Cups Flower</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Baking Soda</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Sea Salt</li>
        <li>2 Sticks Unsalted Butter, room temp</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/4 Cups Light Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tsp Vanilla (more if you're a real one)</li>
        <li>2 Large Eggs at room temp (if you're a millionaire)</li>
        <li>2 Cups Chocholoate Chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350ºF. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. </li>
        <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until creamy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl. Add the vanilla and eggs and beat until combined, scraping the bowl down as needed. Gradually beat in the flour mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>If time permits, wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours but no more than 72 hours. This allows the dough to “marinate” and makes the cookies thicker, chewier, and more flavorful. Let dough sit at room temperature just until it is soft enough to scoop.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 3-tablespoon sized balls using a large cookie scoop and drop onto prepared baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake for 11-13 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Although I prefer cookies fresh from the oven, these can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days. See post for storage tips.</li>
